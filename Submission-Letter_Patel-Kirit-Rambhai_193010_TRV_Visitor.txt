Dear Sir/Madam,
This application refers to our client - Mr. Patel, Kirit Rambhai for a Temporary Residence Visa - Visitor. Please find the Use of Representative (IMM5476) in our favor.
Purpose of Visit
The applicant intends to temporarily visit Canada on a summer vacation (June 16, 2023, to June 30, 2023). The principal purpose of his visit is to spend some solitude time in Canada, since he has been occupied for quite a long time in his professional commitments. This trip is majorly intended to find peace for a few days, away from all his responsibilities in a country that is beautiful in its own way for solo travelers.
In Canada, he plans to explore the Vancouver city of the British Columbia province. The applicant will go to the Beaches of English Bay and Spanish Banks. Then he will go camping at Alice Lake and Golden Ears Provincial Park. Thereafter, the applicant will go to Granville Island to do some shopping. The applicant will spend his daytime in the Lower Mainland at WildPlay in Maple Ridge. Mr. Patel also wishes to be a part of the Bard on the Beach Shakespeare Festival. He will cover all the major places famous in Vancouver, from the Stanley Park to the Vancouver Aquarium, to the Capilano Suspension Bridge Park, and Science World. He would try to make the most of his solo trip to Canada.
Ties to the Country of Residence - India
We would like to inform you that the applicant is well-settled in his country of residence - India. Professionally, Mr. Patel, Kirit Rambhai has been admitted as an Advocate with Bar Council of Gujarat, in the Ahmedabad city since May 5, 2000. He has been practicing in the High Court of Gujarat, since August 2001. He handles the civil, criminal, land, and service related cases and he is responsible from consultation services to every type of court proceedings. The profession of Mr. Patel requires him to be committed to his motherland and abide by all the rules of India. Thus, he will ensure complying with all the norms of Canada as a responsible immigrant and will leave the nation on the stipulated time along with his spouse and two children. His annual compensation is INR 582,142 (equivalent to CAD $9,679.57*).
We would like to inform you that the applicant has strong family ties in India. Mr. Patel, Kirit Rambhai married Ms. Patel, Aruna Kiritbhai on May 22, 2005. Ms. Patel has always been a homemaker. With the birth of their daughter - Miss Patel, Jasmira Kiritbhai, she was occupied in her upbringing and her education. Currently, Miss Patel is in Grade X at Sri Mirambika English Medium School. Likewise, they have a son - Master Patel, Param, who is in Grade IV-B at St. Ann's Primary School, Sabarmati. Since both the children are currently studying and with their mother being occupied in their education, neither of them will accompany the applicant on this trip to Canada.
As far as his family ties are concerned, the applicant lives in the bustling city of Ahmedabad along with his spouse, children, and mother - Ms. Patel, Amrutben Rambhai and his spouse's mother - Ms. Ambaben Kantilal. He has his siblings - Ms. Patel, Meenaben M., Mr. Patel Manishbhai R., and Ms. Patel, Varshaben R. living in the same city.
The applicant is dearly connected with his extended family of cousins, uncles, aunts, nieces, nephews, and friends. They spend time together at family functions or special occasions.
